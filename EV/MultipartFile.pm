=head1 MultipartFile IMPLEMENTATIONS, BLOCKING AND CALLBACKS 

If callback specified it will always called after IO completion no matter what HTTP::Server::IO implementation used.

If you use L<HTTP::Server::EV::IO::AIO> then only way to know ->save status is specify callback, because ->save call will return immediately and set saving to background. You can`t use ->fh without callback.

If you use L<HTTP::Server::EV::IO::Blocking> then all IO operations will block program. You can use methods withouth a callbacks.

If you use L<Coro> then HTTP::Server::EV::IO::AIO will act as HTTP::Server::EV::IO::Blocking and block current Coro thread if no callback specified, or return immediately and call callback if it specified.
